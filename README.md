How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
- This begins with a conversation with our customer or business problem and gathering requirements. Creating user stores from the requirements helps break the huge ask into smaller definable needs which we can tackle one at a time. More importantly, this translates the requirement into an easily understandable statement that we can take action on.
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
- Once we've broken down the requirements into user stories, we need to orgnaize our priortized workload into small manageable tasks. Using sprint planning we can deliver working software incrementally and receive feedback in at a manageable pace. Sprint planning and retrospectives would be very ideal to have in my future development work.
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
- Honestly just communicate well. Actively listen to others before sharing your opinion or ideas. Be honest and straight forward when you communicate, it will make everything work better. "You must first listen, in order to be heard."
